## Thoughts

This was a pretty interesting project. For the most part, nothing from this one was new to me since I have experience making togglable navs. What I did learn though, is great refactoring tips. Before the last section of this course, the JS was very repetitive. I think They did a really good job of using an array with a for each loop on it to go through all of the items to skip the repetition. I remember I tried to do something similar, and I made it WAY more complicated than it needed to be with multiple if statements, template strings, and using the `eval()` function to make it work. I love to make things harder on myself apparently.
